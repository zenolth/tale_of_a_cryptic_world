## Code styling
Please follow the ESLint rules I have set up, they may be strict for some people but this is to ensure consistency.
## Building
You can use either [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).<br/>
### With Bun (Recommended)
```sh
bun install # Install dependencies
bun run build
```
### With Node.js
```sh
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run build
```
Both methods will output the built Luau source files into `out/` with the same structure as `src/`.
